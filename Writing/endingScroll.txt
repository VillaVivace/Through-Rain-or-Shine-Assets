Good Ending:
The remaining survivors of Cherrywood Pines were able to find closure in their regret. However, your job is not done, there are still so many letters left to deliver, including the dead man’s letter. His kid is out there somewhere and you intend to find them, whatever it takes. Onto the next town.


Neutral Ending:
You try your best but you can’t save them all. Such is Life. You trudge forward, knowing that you must deliver the letters for the sake of humanity’s hope, whatever the cost. Onto the next town.


Bad Ending:
Congrats your an asshole. You were actually trying to do this right? Because otherwise… just wow. Onto the next town I guess?
